# melvor-mod-template

Mod template with full directory structure. Don't forget to update manifest.json.

If you install nwjs version 0.54.0 into you MelvorIdle install location you can also change the paths in `launch.json` to enable vscode to launch the game with a debugger attached (this also enabled F12 to open the devtools on the steam version).

Partially based on https://github.com/CherryMace/melvor-idle-mod-boilerplate.
